# intro
# =============
# this is an WAN setup for PPPoE subscribers.

# instructions
# =============
# name the PPPoE profile instead of gc58jmno1a.
# put the underlying WAN interface instead of d4ecwm76ks.
# name the PPPoE interface instead of p9xozu6ya5.
# put username and password per this PPP interface instead of nziktxwph6 and
# bzr7ni1r3y respectively.

# to access NTP servers without resolving any domain name,
# put each actual server address where 0.0.0.1 and 0.0.0.2 stand respectively.
/system ntp client set enabled=yes primary-ntp=0.0.0.1 secondary-ntp=0.0.0.2

# to access NTP servers through domain name lookup,
# put an actual NTP server domain where time.arpa.home stands.
# this requires an /ip dns setup.
/system ntp client set enabled=yes primary-ntp=0.0.0.0 secondary-ntp=0.0.0.0 server-dns-names=time.arpa.home

# session-timeout should be chosen so that CPE's PADT manages to reach the other
# end before CPE receives any PADT. "/ip upnp interfaces" is a better place to
# manage UPnP per interface than is use-upnp, since the former marks an
# interface as external/internal, hence use-upnp=no.
/ppp profile add bridge-learning=no change-tcp-mss=no name=gc58jmno1a only-one=no session-timeout=1d23h59m47s use-compression=no use-encryption=no use-ipv6=no use-mpls=no use-upnp=no

# it is possible for CPE to PPPoE over VLAN, albeit such practice is not
# thorougly tested. the mileage varies as on how to find the VLAN ID.
# choose keepalive-timeout so that it does not overwhelm the other end.
# this is achieved through eliminating LCP Echo-Request singletons without a
# matching LCP Echo-Reply. an elapse as large as 30 seconds suffices.
# this amount is taken off a manual from Juniper's and managed to withstand
# trials of time. max-mru and max-mtu are chosen so that the setup accomodates
# baby jumbo frames.
